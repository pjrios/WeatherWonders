# WeatherWonders
Our project aims to bridge the gap between traditional painted artwork and digital art by creating a weather-aware device that showcases digital art within a physical frame that imitates traditional painted artwork. The device provides an interactive experience for users by generating digital art based on weather data retrieved from the Open Weather Map API. Users can interact with a webpage to register their devices and input their location to accurately represent the weather in their region. Digital art is generated using Stable diffusion and is limited to landscapes or natural elements that represent the weather.

We chose this project to explore the potential of artificial intelligence and technology in creating interactive art that adapts to the environment. The project aims to create a unique and engaging experience for users interested in traditional and/or digital art, home decor, and technology. By imitating different types of artworks, the device creates a seamless blend between art and technology, providing an innovative and aesthetic experience.
