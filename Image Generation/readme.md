# Overview
The image generation script uses the OpenWeatherMap API to obtain the current state of the weather using the latitude and longitude as parameters. The weather data is processed to extract important information such as the current time of day (morning, afternoon, or evening). The image generation prompt is created with the help of the GTP4All engine, which generates a clear and descriptive prompt using the computed weather and temporal information to make image generation easier for the subsequent image generation models. The prompt generation process also sets image details such as size. The script uses Stable Diffusion models to generate an image based on the provided prompt and image parameters. The resulting image is then saved in a local storage unit for future use.
